# AWS Big Data Pipeline

This repository contains Python code examples for building a Big Data pipeline on AWS to process large volumes of data using various AWS services.

## Overview

The Big Data pipeline is designed to handle the processing of massive amounts of data, up to 100,000 petabytes daily, on AWS. It leverages the power and scalability of AWS services to ingest, process, store, analyze, and visualize the data.

## Features

- Data ingestion from various sources to Amazon S3
- Data processing using AWS Lambda and AWS Glue
- Data storage in Amazon S3
- Data analysis and visualization with Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight
- Monitoring and governance using AWS CloudTrail and AWS CloudWatch
- Security and compliance through IAM roles and policies

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate access credentials

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/techiesp9/BiGData_piepeline_AWS.git


2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Modify the Python code files (`pipeline.py`, `lambda.py`, `glue.py`) to suit your specific requirements. Add your AWS credentials and update parameters as needed.

2. Run the code files as individual scripts or integrate them into your pipeline workflow.


3. Follow the instructions within the code files to configure and deploy AWS services, such as AWS Lambda functions and AWS Glue jobs.
